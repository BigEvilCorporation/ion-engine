            This method is intended to be called at executable init time. 
            It let us avoid exceptions when executing sharpmake several times in loops(exception can occur in the cs compiler
            when it tries to create pdb files and some already exists. Maybe that previous sharpmake sometimes still has some handles to the file?).
            With this cleanup code active there is no exception anymore on my PC. Previously I had the exception almost 100% on the second or third iteration
            of a stability test(executing sharpmake in loop to insure it always generate the same thing).

            Was previously having the following exception when running stability tests(on subsequents sharpmake execution runs):

            <remarks>
            When an enumeration is marked with <see cref="T:Sharpmake.Fragment"/>, Sharpmake normally ensure that
            each element sets 1 and only 1 bit. However, it is often useful in a bit enum to combine
            multiple bits together to create sets that go well together. To prevent Sharpmake from
            considering those errors, you must decorate these enum members with
            <see cref="T:Sharpmake.CompositeFragmentAttribute"/>.

            Because loading an extension in a remote assembly for validation is expensive, this

            the extension in the current <see cref="T:System.AppDomain"/> instead of doing so in a remote

            <see cref="T:Sharpmake.SharpmakeExtensionAttribute"/>, and then loading it again in
            <see cref="P:System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain"/>. However, because it is impossible to unload a
            loaded assembly from the CLR, if this method fail you have essentially polluted the

            that you can see in the Summary on the right.
            Each workflow contains a number of mandatory components, but also a list of optional ones.

             This is used to activate a workaround in fastbuild for the VS2012 preprocessor enum bug. 
             
             Notes: Only win64 is affected by this bug it seems.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             VS 2012 sometimes generates corrupted code when preprocessing an already preprocessed file when it encounters
             enum definitions.
             Example:
            enum dateorder
            {
                no_order, dmy, mdy, ymd, ydm
            };
             Become :
            enummdateorder
            {
                no_order, dmy, mdy, ymd, ydm
            };
             And then compilation fails.
             
             It seems that by adding a space between the enum keyword and the name it avoids that problem that looks like memory corruption in the compiler.
             Also it seems that this doesn't occurs with VS2013.

             </summary>
            
             The compiler generated XML file can be distributed alongside your .NET assembly so that
             Visual Studio and other IDEs can use IntelliSense to show quick information about types
             or members.
             Additionally, the XML file can be run through tools like DocFX and Sandcastle
             to generate API reference websites
            
             The following will output an XML file in the target directory with the same root filename as the assembly
            
                 conf.XmlDocumentationFile = @"[conf.TargetPath]\[project.AssemblyName].xml";
